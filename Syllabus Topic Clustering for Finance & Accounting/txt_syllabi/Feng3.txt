Academic Honesty
Feng Chia University defines academic misconduct as any act by a student that
misrepresents the student’s own academic work or that compromises the academic
work of another. Scholastic misconduct includes (but is not limited to) cheating on
assignments or examinations; plagiarizing, i.e., misrepresenting as one’s own work
any work done by another; submitting the same paper, or a substantially similar paper,
to meet the requirements of more than one course without the approval and consent of
the instructors concerned; or sabotaging another’s work within these general
definitions. Instructors, however, determine what constitutes academic misconduct in
the courses they teach. Students found guilty of academic misconduct in any portion
of the academic work face penalties that range from the lowering of their course grade
to awarding a grade of E for the entire course.
