RECOMMENDATION:
Successful completion of Introduction to Accounting UGBA 102A
COURSE OBJECTIVE:
This Course introduces the student to concepts, theory and applications to: 1.) develop basic skills in financial
statement analysis; 2.) teach students to identify the relevant financial data used in a variety of decision contexts,
such as equity valuation, forecasting firm-level economic variables, distress predictions; and 3.) help students
appreciate the factors that influence the outcome of the financial reporting process, such as the incentives of
reporting parties regulatory rules, and the firm’s competitive environment.
COURSE OPERATIONS:
This class meets three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The regular classes on
Monday and Wednesday will be led by Mr. Stanton. These classes will include lecturing, some
group work and analysis of videos showing "real world situations". Students are expected to have
read the assigned materials and attempted the suggested problems before class. In addition students
will need to take notes since lectures use a white board and power points. Copies of power point
slides will not be distributed. Attendance is especially important since group work is done in
class and can’t be made up.
2
Fridays are review sessions, led by teaching assistants. During these sessions, teaching assistants
will discuss solutions to assigned homework problems and suggested problems; they will not cover
new material. I will attend some of these review sessions on both an announced and unannounced
basis to assist you with understanding the solutions to the problems. It is important that you work
problems before solutions are discussed because you will be unable to solve new problems by trying
to memorize solutions to old problems.
GRADING POLICY:
The Course grade will be based on the total numerical score on the following ( except for the rule on
homework stated below ):
Points

(COMPREHENSIVE)
The student community at UC Berkeley has adopted the following Honor Code:
“As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” The
hope and expectation is that you will adhere to this code.
Collaboration and Independence: Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be
enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise
instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently and materials submitted as homework
should be the result of one’s own independent work.
Cheating: A good lifetime strategy is always to act in such a way that no one would ever imagine that you
would even consider cheating. Anyone caught cheating on a quiz or exam in this course will receive a failing
grade in the course and will also be reported to the University Center for Student Conduct. In order to
guarantee that you are not suspected of cheating, please keep your eyes on your own materials and do not
converse with others during the quizzes and exams.
Plagiarism: To copy text or ideas from another source without appropriate reference is plagiarism and will
result in a failing grade for your assignment and usually further disciplinary action. For additional
5
information on plagiarism and how to avoid it, see, for example:
http://gsi.berkeley.edu/teachingguide/misconduct/prevent-plag.html
Academic Integrity and Ethics: Cheating on exams and plagiarism are two common examples of dishonest,
unethical behavior. Honesty and integrity are of great importance in all facets of life. They help to build a
sense of self-confidence, and are key to building trust within relationships, whether personal or professional.
There is no tolerance for dishonesty in the academic world, for it undermines what we are dedicated to doing
– furthering knowledge for the benefit of humanity.
Your experience as a student at UC Berkeley is hopefully fueled by passion for learning and replete with
fulfilling activities. And we also appreciate that being a student may be stressful. There may be times when
there is temptation to engage in some kind of cheating in order to improve a grade or otherwise advance your
career. This could be as blatant as having someone else sit for you in an exam, or submitting a written
assignment that has been copied from another source. And it could be as subtle as glancing at a fellow
student’s exam when you are unsure of an answer to a question and are looking for some confirmation. One
might do any of these things and potentially not get caught. However, if you cheat, no matter how much you
may have learned in this class, you have failed to learn perhaps the most important lesson of all.
