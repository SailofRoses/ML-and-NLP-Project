I. 
Course Overview 
This course is an introductory course in management accounting and is primarily aimed at 
students majoring, double-majoring, and minoring in business administration. In addition, cost 
information serves as the basis for calculating financial accounting information through the 
process of determining sales prices, inventory asset prices, and generating profits, and provides 
key information for performance evaluation and compensation. Therefore, in order to understand 
a company as a whole, it is essential to understand the flow of cost information throughout the 
entire process of corporate activities, from the purchase of raw materials to the manufacturing 
and sales activities of products. 
 
It is recommended that students who are double majoring in business administration take the 
"Principles of Accounting Information"  course, which is taken as a basic course in their major, and 
take this course not only because it is suitable for the accounting course map, but also because it will 
actually help them learn, so they basically learn accounting principles.
