Course Description 
Welcome to our Business Finance course! This course provides 
an introduction to the study of corporate financial decision 
making. Financial decisions have an important impact on your 
personal as well as your business life. The tools we explore in 
this course can greatly improve your chances for success with all 
your financial decisions. Some of the topics covered include: the 
time value of money; capital budgeting; financial planning 
models; risk management; the capital asset pricing model; 
strategies for portfolio management; business valuation models; and, options. Since this is an analytical

Course Approach 
This course requires a serious commitment on your part in terms of class preparation. Quizzes will be offered 
that must be completed before class. Classes will consist of lectures, group exercises, classroom discussions of 
financing problems and business cases, and discussions about current events related to the course subject 
matter. Students are expected to actively participate in these activities. There will be three (3) tests, 
homework assignments, and a course project. Students will be responsible for checking Blackboard each week 
for announcements, syllabus changes, and clarifications of assignments. Group and individual assignments
