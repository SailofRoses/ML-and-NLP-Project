Course Overview and Goals 
The aim of this module is to introduce and to develop the basic concepts and tools used in modern 
finance.  This module provides an introduction to financial markets and the different financial assets, 
including equities, fixed income securities and derivatives.  It outlines different valuation models for 
projects (or other physical investments), equities, fixed income securities, options and futures.  A key 
focus of this module is the assessment of risk and return and the introduction of some ground breaking 
finance theory, such as diversification and portfolio theory and the CAPM. 
 
This course integrates Excel spreadsheet modeling and in particular the Excel optimizer Solver to 
demonstrate some computer based application of some financial concepts introduced in this module.  
It also focuses on current developments, such as the financial crises of 2007, the Euro crisis and 
various other news stories.

●

● 
Students should be able to understand and assess current developments in finance and financial 
markets.

better financial decisions.

Grades 
At NYU Stern, we strive to create courses that challenge students intellectually and that 
meet the Stern standards of academic excellence. To ensure fairness and clarity of grading, 
the Stern faculty have adopted a grading guideline for core courses with enrollments of more 
than 25 students in which approximately 35% of students will receive an “A” or “A-“ grade. In 
core classes of less than 25 students, the instructor is at liberty to give whatever grades they 
think the students deserve, while maintaining rigorous academic standards. 
 
Letter grades for the entire course will be assigned as follows:

Course Materials 
Required Textbooks & Materials 
There is no required textbook for this course as the course material distributed to students is 
quite substantial.   
However, some students might find it useful to read the topics in a textbook again.  A very 
easy textbook which covers most (if not all) of the topics in this course is the recommended 
textbook used in New York.  It is however not necessary to have the latest edition of this 
textbook as the changes from edition to edition are minimal.  Many other textbook cover the 
same material and are also suitable.   
● In New York Bodie, Z., Kane, A. and Marcus, A.J. ‘Essentials of Investments’, 
McGraw-Hill is the main textbook. [Insert textbook or material name] 
Optional Textbooks & Materials 
● Bodie, Z., Kane, A. and Marcus, A.J. ‘Essentials of Investments’, McGraw-Hill (any 
edition from the 5th edition would be sufficient, but if possible the latest edition would 
be desirable) – main textbook also used in New York. 
● Cuthbertson, K. and Nitzsche, D. (2008) ‘Investments’, J. Wiley, 2nd edition

Classroom Conduct  
Academic communities exist to facilitate the process of acquiring and exchanging knowledge 
and understanding, to enhance the personal and intellectual development of its members, 
and to advance the interests of society. Essential to this mission is that all members of the 
University Community are safe and free to engage in a civil process of teaching and learning 
through their experiences both inside and outside the classroom. Accordingly, no student 
should engage in any form of behaviour that interferes with the academic or educational 
process, compromises the personal safety or well-being of another, or disrupts the 
administration of University programs or services.  Please refer to the NYU Disruptive 
Student Behavior Policy for examples of disruptive behavior and guidelines for response and 
enforcement.

Dirk Nitzsche affiliation with New York University in London goes back to 2001 when he started 
teaching the module Foundations of Finance (previously known as Foundations of Financial Markets).

Business School at Imperial College, London.  At Cass Business School, Dirk is also the Associate 
Dean for International Relations. 
 
After completing his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Newcastle, he worked in the Department 
of Economics at the University of Newcastle between 1994 and 1997, before joining City University

Financial Engineering: Derivatives and Risk Management (2001) and Quantitative Financial 
Economics (2nd edition)(2004). In 2008 the second edition of the Investment textbook was published.  
 
His research interests can broadly be described as asset pricing and efficiency of financial markets 
and more recently he analyses the performance of unit trusts and hedge funds. His recent research 
addressed the question whether the performance of mutual funds can be explained by luck or skill 
and calculations about the False Discovery Rate of well performing mutual funds.  The new project 
looks at aspects of persistence of mutual fund performance.
