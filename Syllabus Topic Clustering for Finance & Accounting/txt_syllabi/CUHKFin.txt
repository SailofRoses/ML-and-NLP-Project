Course Description 
Foundation of Finance is an introduction to the foundations of modern financial 
economics. The focus throughout will be on the development and interpretation of 
discrete-time models of asset pricing, and the valuation of risky cash flow. After 
developing and studying the details of consumer decision-making under uncertainty, it 
uses that general framework as a basis for understanding both equilibrium and no-
arbitrage theories of securities pricing, including traditional models like the capital asset 
pricing model (CAPM) and the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), newer Arrow-Debreu 
theories, and the consumption capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) and, if time permits, 
martingale pricing methods. The course is primarily theoretical.  However, I may discuss 
some empirical puzzles in finance.  
 
This course is intended for second year undergraduate students in finance and economics. 
While there are no formal prerequisites for enrolling in this course, a working knowledge 
of calculus, linear algebra, and probability plus statistics is especially useful. 
 
The course grade will be based on the following: one midterm exam (30%); and a final 
exam (40%). The midterm and final are in-class close-book exams. The midterm  will be 
in late March or early April. The final will be in the third week of May. There is NO 
option to transfer the midterm weight to final weight, except for medical or family 
emergency (see Policy on Absence below). The material covered in each exam is up to 
what we've learned by the time the exam is conducted. The last 30% of the grade is based 
on grades of homework.  
 
Homework will be assigned almost every week and will be due one week after the 
assignment. Teaching assistants will go through the solution in the tutorial one week after 
it is assigned. Students are encouraged to discuss the homework problems with other 
students, but should work through all of the mathematics individually. Please submit 
homework to Blackboard on time. NO score for homework tuned in after the deadline. If 
you miss class on a day when a problem set is due, please scan your answers and email 
them to TAs before the deadline. 
 
The main textbooks corresponding to the suggested reading are given below. The 
textbooks are NOT required. Some people find the textbooks helpful and some people do 
not. Read the description below before you decide on whether you feel it would be worth 
it for you to buy the textbooks: 
 
(1) Intermediate Financial Theory by Jean-Pierre Danthine and John B. Donaldson, 
2014 (Undergrad Level or above) 
(2) Asset Pricing by John H. Cochrane, 2005 (Master Level or above) 
(3) Asset Pricing and Portfolio Choice Theory by Kerry Back, 2010 (PhD Level) 
 
Additional textbooks are also helpful: Theory of Financial Decision Making by J. 
Ingersoll, 1987, and Foundations for financial economics by C. F. Huang and R. H. 
Litzenberger, 1988. I will refer to these texts as (1) DD, (2) JC, (3) KB, JI, and HL, 
respectively. 
 
Below is a list of topics to be covered.  I reserve the right to change the syllabus 
(modestly) as the course progresses. Under each topic I summarize relevant reading and 
provide a number of classic references.  Students are required to read the textbook 
readings marked with *.  Students who plan to apply for graduate programs in finance 
and economics are encouraged to read the book materials without *. The topics without * 
will not be included in the exams. Students who are serious about research and plan to 
apply PhD programs should also read some additional articles without *. I will generally 
provide lecture slides or notes summarizing key points made in class. 
 
 
 
Course Materials 
I will post lecture slides, some class readings, and homework assignments on 
https://bb.cuhk.edu.cn. The lecture slides are based on Prof. Peter Ireland’s lecture notes. 
Thus, the copyright of the slides belongs to Peter Ireland. Redistribution is permitted for 
education and research purpose, so long as no charges are made. All copies must be 
provided free of charge and must include the copyright notice. 
 
 
Staying Up-to-Date  
You are encouraged to follow financial and macroeconomic news in the Financial Times, 
Wall Street Journal, The Economist, or VoxChina. If you encounter an interesting article 
that you would like to share with the class, send me an email and I will post it on the 
class website. 
 
 
Honor Code 
All students are expected to adhere to the University's Code of Academic Integrity, which 
is designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty and integrity are upheld.  
The Smith School does not tolerate academic dishonesty.  All acts of academic 
dishonesty will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this code.  Please visit 
the following website for more information on the University's Code of Academic 
Integrity: http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/departsite/ar/en/Academic.html 
 
 
Policies on Absence and Late Withdrawal 
Absences from class because of illness or important schedule conflicts are sometimes 
inevitable and should be fine so long as they are isolated in number. If you can’t make it 
to class on any given day, you can check the course webpage to see the slides you 
missed.  
 
Students who cannot take their midterm exams as scheduled because of documented 
serious illness, or compelling unexpected circumstances may appeal for weight 
transferring to final exams. Students who cannot take their final exams as scheduled 
because of documented serious illness, or compelling unexpected circumstances may 
appeal for make-up final exam. The following are examples that are not considered 
compelling reasons to grant a weight transferring or a make-up exam: lack of preparation, 
negligence, misinformation, or planned vacations and other events. 
 
Please submit late withdrawal application before the midterm. Late withdrawals can only 
be granted before the midterm. After midterm, no late withdrawal will be proved.  
 
 
Special Needs 
Any student with special needs should bring this to the attention of the instructor as soon 
as possible, but not later than the second week of class.
