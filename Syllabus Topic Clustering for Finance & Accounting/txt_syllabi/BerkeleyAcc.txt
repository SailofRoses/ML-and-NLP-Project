Course Description & Objectives
This course provides an introduction to the principles of ﬁnancial reporting. The goal of this class
is not to train you to be an accountant. Rather, this class is intended to train you into an informed
user of ﬁnancial statements. I assume no prior knowledge of accounting, and I designed the course
accordingly. I will constantly draw insights from real business anecdotes to contextualize the ac-
counting concepts and the corresponding capital markets implications.
Accounting is an information system that maps a ﬁrm’s economic activities into speciﬁc accounting
numbers. For the ﬁrst half of the class, we will focus on understanding how each business trans-
action impacts speciﬁc accounting numbers. In the second half of the class, you will develop the
ability to analyze a ﬁrm’s operation and business strategy based on its ﬁnancial statements. I will
also occasionally introduce seminal ﬁnance or accounting research to highlight (i) how managers’
incentives distort the mapping process between real business transactions and accounting numbers
and (ii) the investment value of certain accounting numbers.
Speciﬁcally, by the end of this course, you will
• Understand the logic structure that maps business transactions into accounting numbers
• Be able to prepare a set of ﬁnancial statements (i.e., speak the language of accounting)
• Be able to analyze ﬁnancial statements
• Be aware of the limitations of ﬁnancial statement data

Course Materials
• Textbook: Financial Accounting, by Libby, Libby, and Hodge, 10th edition, McGraw-Hill. ISBN:
9781259964947.
• All the reading assignments are based on the 10th edition of the textbook. A different version
of the textbook will result in some difﬁculty in identifying the relevant reading assignments.
• A calculator
• All the lecture notes will be available on bCourse
• Create a Kahoot account (https://kahoot.com) and download the application into your cell-
phone. During class, we will frequently use Kahoot games to solidify your understanding of
the relevant concepts.

Grading
The course grade is determined by the following components:
Constructive Contribution
5%
Team Case Project
5%
Homework Assignments (Lowest grade dropped)
5%
Midterm Exam
30%
Final Exam
55%
The details of each component are discussed below.
4.1
Constructive Contribution
The constructive contribution portion of the grade is NOT narrowly geared towards in-class discus-
sions. Instead, it is intended to encourage (i) all students to contribute to the learning environment
and (ii) all students to show respect for the class and other students. Disruptive behavior, including
(but are not limited to) entering, leaving, texting, or disturbing others during class, will negatively
impact the constructive contribution portion of the grade. If, due to unforeseen emergencies, a
student has to arrive late or leave early during class, please refrain from disrupting the class. Egre-
gious behavior including but not limited to repeated conversing with other students during lectures
2 of 7
and/or repeated being late for classes will lead to a zero or negative participation credit.
Speciﬁcally, the constructive contribution portion of the grade is based on:
• A positive attitude that contributes to the learning environment of the class (e.g., showing
excitement about the topics and respect for the class and other students)
• Helping other students
• Quality and thoughtful contributions shared in class, made with thoughts and preparation
prior to class meetings.
• Sharing with the class accounting-related stories.
4.2
Case Study
Towards the end of the semester, you should work with your team to analyze a case. You are
expected to purchase the case from HBR store (https://store.hbr.org/case-studies/), and the case
should cost less than $10.
To better prepare for your team case project, you are encouraged to form a team as early as possi-
ble. Please form a group with only students from the same section, i.e., students enrolled in UGBA
102A-LEC001 to ensure comparability of grades among students. Due to fairness concerns, a team
cannot have more than ﬁve team members. If, due to unforeseen circumstances, a student has
to form a team of more than ﬁve members, please send me an email, along with the justiﬁcation,
for approval. To create a fair environment for all students, the grade of large teams, i.e., teams
consisting of over ﬁve members, will be subject to an above-20% discount. A team of fewer than
ﬁve members or even going solo is automatically approved.
We will discuss the case in class on November 28, 2022. The case is due on November 27, 2022.
No extensions are possible.
4.3
Homework Assignments
The homework assignments are designed to solidify your understanding of the course materials
and will be graded based on completeness. You can collaborate with other students in complet-
ing the assignments. However, please submit your assignment individually, instead of as a group.
Please identify the names of other students who you have collaborated with in your submission.
If, due to unforeseen emergencies, a student is experiencing signiﬁcant difﬁculties in submitting
the assignment by the deadline, please direct all the homework extension requests to Felipe
Bosselin. See the details about the assignments and corresponding due dates in A.2.
4.4
Midterm & Final Exam
Note that the schedule of the ﬁnal exam is decided by the university based on the day and time a
class is offered. It is important that students do not enroll in another class that is offered at
the same time as this class. Such scheduling conﬂicts will lead to a conﬂict of scheduling for
the ﬁnal exams. The ﬁnal exam is cumulative. No make-up exams are possible. If necessary, we
3 of 7
will use Honorlock or other software of a similar nature to proctor the exams to ensure fairness
among all students.
5
Course Structure
The class will meet three times per week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The regular classes,
held on Monday and Wednesday, will be led by Professor Biwen Zhang. During the regular class,
a combination of lectures, discussions, and in-class practice problems will be used. We will also
constantly make references to real-world business events to illustrate the accounting concepts and
the corresponding capital markets implications. Occasionally, I will also introduce the highlights
of some seminal accounting and ﬁnance research, with an emphasis on the investment value of
accounting information and managerial incentives in the preparation of ﬁnancial statements.
There is also a weekly review session (Friday) led by the graduate student instructor (GSI), i.e,
Felipe Bosselin. During these sessions, Felipe Bosselin will discuss solutions to assigned class exer-
cises. The review sessions will not cover new materials, and are optional. That being said, you are
strongly encouraged to attend the review sessions to solidify your understanding of the relevant
concepts. See the exercises assigned to each review session from A.3.

Class Preparations & Questions about Class Content
Before the class, you should read the corresponding reading assignments and think about the ques-
tions I raised in the Topic Overviews. See the details of reading assignments in A.1. See the Topic
Overviews from bCourse.
After the class, it is inevitable that you have questions about the class content. For each topic and
each assignment, we will create a discussion board where you can ask questions about each topic
and each assignment. You are encouraged to answer questions raised by your classmates. Felipe
Bosselin and I will answer your questions within two days of its posting.
Due to fairness concerns, I will refrain from answering questions via emails, as such correspon-
dences beneﬁt only a small number of students. Please direct all generic questions regarding course
materials to bCourse, where all students can beneﬁt from the answers.
The ofﬁce hours are also a good source for you, as you might have questions regarding the class,
accounting in general, accounting research, or your career.

Academic Integrity
The student community at UC Berkeley have collectively adopted the following Honor Code to
support an environment of academic integrity and respect on campus. “As a member of the UC
Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.” I expect all of you to
comply with the Honor code at all times and under all circumstances.
4 of 7
Also, the following norms were developed by former UC Berkeley students for everyone’s beneﬁt
to improve the learning environment.
• Prompt: Arrive on time at the beginning of class and after breaks
• Present: Do not leave during class unless a personal emergency arises. Scheduled breaks,
when provided, can be used to take care of personal needs.
• Focus: Refrain from being distracted by laptops. The virtual lecturing will for sure nega-
tively impact your learning experience. Thus, it is particularly important now to focus on the
lectures to maintain an effective environment
• Inclusive Step up in class discussions to ensure that a wide variety of voices and perspectives
are heard; encourage classmates to do the same.

Statement for Students with Disabilities
Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with
Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of veriﬁcation for approved accom-
modations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to me (or to the program
ofﬁce) as early in the semester as possible.

Class Schedule & Assignment Dates
The class schedule is drafted based on my best estimates of the ﬂow of the class. As it is more important for you to
fully comprehend the class content than we dutifully follow the schedule, it is likely that the actual class schedule will
be slightly different from the schedule below.
