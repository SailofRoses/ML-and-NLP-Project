REQUIRED TEXTBOOK AND MATERIAL: 
1. Fundamentals of Financial Management, 12th edition, 2010, by Brigham & Houston. 
2. Texas Instruments BAII Plus. 
 
Calculator 
You must have a financial calculator to get through the course. Many of the exam problems involve complex 
arithmetic and financial calculations, and a financial calculator is necessary to solve them. TI-BAII Plus is the 
one recommended and will be used for instructional purposes. The calculator does everything needed in the 
course. I will use one in class and explain how to work various problems with it, so you can follow lectures most 
easily if you use a TI-BAII Plus. As you will soon see, the ability to use a financial calculator is critical to 
success in the class.  Note students may not share calculators on exams. 
 
MOODLE CLASS WEBSITE: 
A class website on Moodle is created for posting messages, homework assignment, exam study guides, and 
additional study materials. Class announcement and due dates will be posted on Moodle.  Group assignments 
are to be submitted electronically to the designated folders on Moodle. Discussion will also be utilized for 
assigned problem discussion and message exchange. 
COURSE REQUIREMENTS: 
Final grade will be determined on the basis of examination grades, performance of assignments, and class 
attendance and participation.  Students are expected to turn in assignments and take exams according to the 
schedule. No late assignment will be accepted, and no make-up exam will be given without an official proof 
being turned in to the instructor prior to the exams. In order to be excused from an exam, the student must 
contact me before the exam.  Excuses will be granted only if the student is unable to take the exam because of 
serious illness or injury, or a significant personal or professional commitment.  Excuses will not be granted for 
social activities such as ski trips, cruises, and trips to sporting events (unless you are participating). Cheating 
and plagiarism on any assignment will result in an "F" grade for the entire course. 
 
Attendance and Participation 
Participation and attendance are important part of successful completion of this course. Some materials and 
assignments will be discussed and completed only in class.  Attendance and participation will be considered 
when computing the course grade.  I will reserve the right to lower your course grade by half a letter grade if 
you have 4 absences and a letter grade if you have 6 absences.  Student who misses more than 8 classes will 
receive an F grade for the entire course. 
 
Quizzes (15%) 
Quizzes will be administered upon completion of every chapter starting Chapter 3. Each quiz will consist of 
one to two questions selected from the assigned Problems in the end of each assigned chapter.  If more than 6 
quizzes are given, test results from the additional quiz will be applied as extra credit to the final average. 
Problems assigned for each chapter and answers to the assigned problems will be posted on Moodle prior to 
the beginning of the chapter. 
 
Group Assignments (15%) 
In the beginning of the class, students should form a study group with no more than 3 members in the group. 
Each group is required to complete the Comprehensive/Spreadsheet Problem at the end of each assigned 
chapter upon completion of the chapter.  Assignments are to be turned in to the specified folder on Moodle 
prior to the meeting time of the class on the due date. Due date for the assignment will be posted on Moodle. 
Additional working papers for the assignments can be submitted in class. 
 
Group Project & Presentation (10%) 
Each student will be involved in a team to analyze a firm and present their finding to the class. The purpose 
of this assignment is to apply the financial concepts learned in this class to a specific firm.  Each group will 
use PowerPoint to present their findings to the class.  Some of the issues to be covered for each project 
include: financial statement analysis, estimating the firm’s cost of capital, estimation and interpretation of 
cash flows, optimal capital structure, etc. 
 
Term Examinations (60%) 
Three term exams and a non-cumulated final exam will be administered throughout the term.  Each exam will 
consist of multiple-choice and problem-solving questions.  Exam contents are taken from the reading and 
hands-on material covered in the course required text. No books and no notebooks will be allowed in the 
examinations.  For the exams you will be allowed to bring in a financial calculator and a 3 by 5 note card.
