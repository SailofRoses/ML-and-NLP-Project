COURSE POLICIES 
“Communications”: 
 
Please check ECO404 Quercus announcements and your UofT E-mail daily. 
 
Double check that:  
o 
Quercus settings are set to “receive notifications” 
o 
You have registered your UofT e-mail account on Quercus 
o 
You are not forwarding your UofT e-mails to an external e-mail account 
 
Quercus “mail” is wonky. As such, please don’t send messages through Quercus “mail”. 
 
Emails must be sent from your University email address and must include your student ID# in the subject field. For emails asking 
for a reply, if we can answer briefly without explaining course content or revealing something of general interest, then we will reply 
within three business days. 
 
It is imperative that you inform us by e-mail asap of any changes to your name and/or e-mail address on file on ACORN and 
Quercus. Penalty for administrative tasks stemming from violating this policy: 5% of your overall course grade. 
 
ECO404 Quercus: submitting assessments for grading and/or detecting plagiarism: 
 
“Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and 
detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they 
will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for Teaching 
Support & Innovation web site https://uoft.me/pdt-faq” 
 
“Accessibility Accommodations”: 
 
The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario 
Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible 
learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University’s 
courses and programs. Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability that may 
require accommodations, the first step is to contact Accessibility Services.  
 
“Religious Accommodations”: 
 
The University provides reasonable accommodation of the needs of students who observe religious holy days other than those 
already accommodated by ordinary scheduling and statutory holidays. You have a responsibility to alert us in a timely fashion to 
upcoming religious observances and anticipated absences that affect your ability to fully participate in this course. We will make 
every reasonable effort to avoid scheduling compulsory activities at these times.  
 
“Academic Integrity”: For anything that counts towards your course grade:  
 
You may not receive assistance from another individual. This includes, but is in no way limited to, any online forum or other digital 
communication as well as any tutoring or assistance service.  
 
You may not give assistance to any individual enrolled in ECO404.  
 
We will report all suspected cases of academic misconduct to the Department of Economics and Dean’s Office. The consequences 
can be severe. Being unaware of the policies or what is considered unauthorized collaboration (e.g., plagiarism) is not a defense. If 
you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behavior, please reach out to me. Please know that the 
University expects you to seek out additional information on academic integrity from me or from other institutional resources. The 
University’s Academic Integrity website is an excellent source of information. Further, it is a course requirement that you have read 
University’s Code of Behavior on Academic Matters, especially section B which outlines what are considered academic offences. 
 
“Requests for Remarking Projects”: 
 
Remarking requests must be submitted after one week, but no later than two weeks, of the assessment returned to the student. 
 
Requests will be accepted neither before nor after this window. 
 
It is important that you clearly articulate why your response merits additional marks. We will re-read your entire assessment. Your 
mark could go up, down, or remain unchanged. 
 
A calculation error does not constitute a “remarking request”: contact the instructor in this case. 
 
“Copyright Policy”: 
 
ECO404 course materials are copyright protected and belong to the instructor, the University, and/or other sources depending on 
the specific facts of each situation. Students may download course materials for their own academic use, and cannot copy, share, or 
use them for any other purpose without the explicit permission of the instructor.
