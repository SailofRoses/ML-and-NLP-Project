COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
 
MGMT 2300 is a course that provides an understanding of the concepts and tools of 
financial accounting. The course will focus on external users of accounting information and 
managerial decision-making. It has a user and a preparer, perspective. As a result, 
participants will be asked not just to do the accounting, but also to interpret the numbers 
and discuss how you would use them for taking action, as well.   
 
REQUIRED TEXT(S):  
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FOR MANAGERS– An interactive, user-oriented approach 
by David W. Young, Crimson Press Curriculum Center.  
COURSE GOALS/OBJECTIVES 
 
The objectives for the course are to make sure that (1) you are familiar with the basic 
concepts of financial accounting, (2) you can work with accounting data in an analytically 
rigorous way, and (3) you understand the structure and process of financial statement 
analysis. 
  
 
Syllabus

2.1.2024 
Accounting is often called the language of business.  Just as with learning a foreign 
language the most effective way to learn this language of business is to learn by doing, 
and to learn progressively. Consequently, you will find that there are huge benefits in 
this course to completing suggested class problems and additional practice 
problems, and most importantly in completing them as we advance through the 
course. 
You have several avenues for practicing and reviewing problems: 
1. Problems for Self-Study throughout each chapter in the textbook. It is very important 
that you complete these self-study problems before attempting the assigned problems. 
2. Problems that are assigned for homework.  Solutions will be posted on Blackboard. 
3. Additional problems assigned in Cases both in the book and posted on Blackboard. 
Solutions will be posted on Blackboard, if requested. 
 
THE LEARNING PROCESS 
  
As you may know, accounting is not a subject that one masters by thinking deep thoughts; 
instead it requires actually analyzing (or attempting to analyze) problems or cases. 
Consequently, the pedagogical approach for the course is a relatively interactive one. In 
general, you will be assigned cases or problems for each class session, which you should 
read and/or analyze prior to the session. You should then analyze the suggested solutions 
posted the following week to determine your understanding of the problems/cases and any 
difficulties you may have encountered in completing them. 
  
Use of Teams 
 
To help with the learning process, the course will use teams. There will be two team 
projects during the semester. In addition, I recommend that you precede each day’s class 
session with a team meeting (if not possible due to your schedules then at least through 
Blackboard would help) of about one-half hour. These meetings can assist considerably in 
the learning process (as two heads are usually better than one).  
 
The team meetings are not a substitute for individual case preparation; indeed, they 
serve this purpose badly. Rather they are designed to serve three purposes: 
 
• 
To allow you to engage in some preliminary discussion of the material in the case or 
problems for the day, to compare the analyses with those of your colleagues, and to reach 
some conclusions. There is no need to reach a team consensus, but there is a need to 
discuss the differences among your approaches, and to understand those differences. 
 
• 
To assist you to learn to work in teams. A very high proportion of your professional 
life will be spent working in teams. Most of you have already worked in teams in one 
capacity or another. Teams can be difficult at times (as can people who, after all, comprise 
them), but they also are a powerful way of making things happen. Look upon this as an 
opportunity to develop your team skills. 
 
• 
To help you to get to know your colleagues better. Many of the relationships you 
develop, as team members will persist throughout your years at RPI, and, in some 
instances, throughout your careers.

COURSE STRUCTURE 
 
A schedule for the course is contained in Exhibit 1. As it shows, MGMT 2300 is covered in 
two modules. The first focuses on the basics of financial accounting (Balance Sheet, 
Income Statement, Statement of Cash flows). The second module focuses on financial 
statement analysis, emphasizing the theme that financial statements are imperative in 
analyzing the financial health of organizations. Its basic thrust is on different ways to 
analyze the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flow numbers that 
can be used for decision-making purposes.  
 
CLASS PREPARATION GUIDELINES 
 
 
All modules make extensive use of problems and cases. You should prepare your 
problem/case analysis in advance of the on-line discussion so you can get immediate 
feedback on your understanding of the material. This is perhaps the most critical aspect of 
the learning process, since it is extremely difficult to “catch up” in this course. 
 
 
In general, the learning process consists of developing new skills, which can only be 
developed by practice. Your learning will be incomplete unless you attempt to analyze the 
problems and cases to the best of your ability before looking at someone else’s solution. 
Additionally, you generally will find the learning process much more enjoyable if you are 
involved in the class discussions, which can only happen in a productive way if you are 
well prepared.  
 
 
Despite the importance of undertaking your analyses in advance of each session, 
please make only a reasonably diligent effort to analyze each problem/case. If for some 
reason you get stuck, push yourself a little bit, and then, if you are not making progress, 
stop. The Law of Diminishing Returns sets in fairly quickly, and there is no point in 
becoming overly frustrated. It is important to push yourself a little prior to stopping work, 
however, since, if you have done so, both your team meeting and the on-line discussion 
will make a great deal more sense to you. 
 
 
In general, except for those classes that focus on a chapter, each session will be spent 
working through the assigned questions for the case. For this reason, your principal focus 
in preparation should be on the problems and cases. That is, reading and understanding 
the chapter is a means to the end of analyzing the assigned problems and cases; it is not 
an end in itself. 
 
STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES 
Students will learn the basic concepts of financial accounting which includes the commonly 
used financial statements. This requires students to familiarize themselves with the 
preparation and interpretation of the balance sheet, income statement, the statement of 
retained earnings and the statement of cash flows. In addition, students will be required to 
analyze these important financial statements through the use of ratio analysis. Finally, 
students will learn not just to do the accounting, but also to interpret the numbers and 
discuss how to use them for taking action, as well.

COURSE ASSESSMENT MEASURES  
 
Exams and Quizzes 
 
 
All exams will test your knowledge of the basics of financial and managerial accounting. 
You can prepare for the exams by fully analyzing the class materials and cases that 
precede it. Quizzes will be administered bi-weekly and will test your knowledge of the class 
materials and cases that precede each quiz. Quizzes will not be announced and will be 
pop quizzes throughout the semester. Hence, it is important for you to attend each 
and every class. If you miss a quiz, no make-up quiz can be administered without a 
note from the undergraduate office dean.  
 
The written case analysis 
 
 
Each written case should take the form of a memorandum, and should be a team effort 
with no collaboration of any sort outside the team, either with students in the course or with 
people not in the course. The memorandum may be single spaced, but should be no more 
than two pages in length and should include at least one exhibit. 
 
Homework 
 
Homework will be collected in almost each class and will cover the cases at the end of the 
chapters in each book. Please refer to the course calendar to determine when homework 
is due and the case that is to be analyzed. A hard copy must be turned in when due to 
earn the full points for this assessment.  
 
Classroom Contribution 
 
 
Finally, because (1) there is a need for regular preparation, (2) the pedagogy relies on 
both preparation and presentation of key questions or case analyses. These contributions 
can come in a variety of ways: (1) a good question about the material, (2) understanding 
key analyses of (as opposed to restating factual points in) a case, (3) helping to move the 
discussion forward, or (4) making comments that bridge discussion points in a case or 
between two or more cases, thereby integrating the learning process and helping to make 
it more coherent. Please refer to the attachments to the syllabus. 
 
In considering the classroom contribution portion of your grade in the course, please keep 
three very important facts in mind: 
 
• While being present is better than being absent, being present and saying nothing does 
not constitute classroom contribution. As the second sentence of the second paragraph 
of Exhibit 3 says, “Mere physical presence is not participation.” 
 
• A comment in the ‘A’ category does not have to be long, nor is one expected to make 
lots of ‘A’ comments during any given case discussion. One or two short but incisive 
comments during a given case discussion are perfectly adequate. Also, to earn a grade 
 
Syllabus 
5 of 15 
2.1.2024 
of ‘A’ does not require the kind of participation described above for every case in the 
course, but I do expect regular participation of this sort. 
 
• While mere physical presence is not participation, physical presence is a prerequisite 
for contribution. Therefore, you should attend every class, and arrive on time. 
Accordingly, the following approach will be used to assign your class contribution 
grade:

ATTENDANCE POLICY 
 
You will be allowed one absence and one late arrival during the semester. After that, for 
each evaluation period, once I have assigned a grade for your classroom contribution, I will 
deduct five points from that grade for every absence during the evaluation period, and 
three points for each late arrival. 
 
If, for example, for the first grading period, I assign you a grade of 90 for your classroom 
contribution, and you have had two absences, and one late arrival, your actual grade 
would be 82. If the same things happened during the second grading period, your actual 
grade would be 77. 
 
If, when the second evaluation is being completed, and you have had no absences during 
the term, I will add five points to your grade. 
   
  In addition, as each class builds on the previous class, attendance will be taken at each 
class and if you miss three classes it will be assumed that you have dropped the 
class. If you were sick and asked not to attend class you will need to bring in a doctor’s 
certificate certifying that you could not attend.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  
 
Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. For example, students must trust that 
teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses 
they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their 
own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process. The Rensselaer 
Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the Graduate Student Supplement 
(For Graduate courses) define various forms of Academic Dishonesty and you should 
make yourself familiar with these. In this class, all assignments that are turned in for a 
grade must represent the student’s own work. In cases where help was received, or 
teamwork was allowed, a notation on the assignment should indicate your collaboration. 
Submission of any assignment that is in violation of this policy will result in a penalty of 0 
for that assignment and the offense will be reported to the Associate Dean for Academic 
Affairs. If there is a subsequent infraction the student will receive a grade of F for the 
course. 
 
COVID-19 Syllabus Guidelines – Lally School of Management 
  
Students taking Lally School of Management classes are required to abide by the 
COVID-19 code of conduct below. This code will apply to any class that meets fully 
or partially in an on-campus physical classroom for in-person instruction. 
Violations: Refusal to comply with the COVID-19 code of conduct will be treated just 
as any classroom disruption, which will receive request for immediate compliance, 
failing which the student will be asked to leave the classroom. Any further 
noncompliance will result in the dismissal of the entire class. All Covid-19 related 
violations will be reported by the instructor to the Compliance Officer at Lally School, 
and the Dean of Students. A student found to be in violation of the code, or required 
repeated reminders for compliance, will be asked to participate in all classes remotely. 
This is to protect their health and safety as well as the health and safety of their 
classmates, instructor, and the university community. 
 
Masks: All students must wear a mask in classrooms and all public places including 
anywhere inside Pittsburgh building. Masks will be provided to the student by the 
Institute. 
 
Traffic Flow and Social Distancing: Students and faculty will respect the need for 
social distancing. They are required to follow the traffic flow arrows posted in all rooms 
and buildings, including bathrooms and common areas.  
 
In-Class Seating: Students should sit in the appropriate designated seating in the 
classroom. Students are not allowed to move furniture or sit in seats not designated by 
the Institute.  
 
Cleaning of Spaces: Students are encouraged to clean the surfaces of the 
chairs/tables/desks they occupy before they sit down and as they prepare to leave. 
Cleaning and sanitizing solutions will be provided in the classroom. 
  
Students who are ill, under quarantine for COVID-19, or suspect they are ill 
should not come to class. All faculty will make every reasonable effort to 
 
Syllabus 
7 of 15 
2.1.2024 
accommodate the student’s absence and will communicate that accommodation directly 
to the student. Students who need to report an illness should contact the Student 
Health Center via email or call 518-276-6287. For student seen off campus, a student 
may request an excused absence via www.bit.ly/rpiabsence with an uploaded doctor’s 
note that excuses them. 
 
If you have any question about the information in this syllabus, please let me know as soon 
as possible or early in the semester.

RE: 
    Class Contribution  Self Assessment #1 
DATE:____________________________________________________________________ 
  
As the course syllabus indicates, because the case method relies on both preparation and 
presentation of case analyses, your course performance will be graded in part on the quality of 
your contributions to class discussions. This self-assessment is used because the issue of grading 
class contribution frequently is a topic of concern to students. The specific criteria the associated 
letter grades and point ranges, are as follows: 
 
A/A- 
Contributes in a significant way to classroom discussions, regularly (a) 
undertaking key analyses from information in the case, (b) applying chapter 
concepts to the case analysis, (c) moving the discussion ahead, and/or (d) making 
comments that bridge discussion points in the case, thereby integrating the 
discussion and helping to make it more coherent. 
 
 
Point range = 90-100 
 
B+/B/B- 
Makes comments that point out important case facts, but that are not particularly 
analytical,  and do not move the discussion ahead or bridge between points in the 
discussion.   
 
 
Point range = 70-85 
 
C+/C/C- 
Makes comments that restate case facts but that are not particularly pertinent to 
the discussion, or that slow the class down by virtue of their peripheral or non-
existent relationship to the subject under discussion.  These comments also may 
reflect a lack of understanding of how the chapter concepts apply to the case 
situation. 
  
Point range = 50-65 
 
D 
 
Makes comments only once or twice during the grading period. 
 
 
Point range = 1-45, depending on quality of the comments. 
 
Failing  
No classroom participation.   
 
 
Points = 0 
 
Remember, a comment in the "A" category does not have to be long, nor is one expected 
to make lots of "A" comments.  One or two short but incisive comments of this sort during a case 
discussion are perfectly adequate. Moreover, given the new nature of the material to you, a good 
question also is considered to be an "A"  comment. Also, a grade of "A" does not require the 
kind of participation described above for every case in the course, but it does require fairly 
regular participation of this sort.  It is difficult to earn such a grade unless you contribute 
significantly to all case discussions.  
 
Please turn in this form on the date indicated in the syllabus. You should assess your 
class contribution performance for course to date or since the last self-assessment. Use the above 
criteria, give yourself a numerical score, and give me some specific examples to support your 
self-assessment.

RE: 
    Class Contribution Self Assessment #2 
DATE: _____________________________________________________________________ 
  
As the course syllabus indicates, because the case method relies on both preparation and 
presentation of case analyses, your course performance will be graded in part on the quality of 
your contributions to class discussions. This self-assessment is used because the issue of grading 
class contribution frequently is a topic of concern to students. The specific criteria the associated 
letter grades and point ranges, are as follows: 
A/A- 
Contributes in a significant way to classroom discussions, regularly (a)

concepts to the case analysis, (c) moving the discussion ahead, and/or (d) making

discussion and helping to make it more coherent.
