Course Policies on Missed or Late Academic Requirements
Students who are unable to write the midterm exam because of illness will 
need to complete and submit the Student Declaration of Absence form to me
by email prior to the start of the exam. The weight of the midterm will be 
transferred to the final exam. There will be no make-up midterm exam.
Students who are unable to write the final exam because of illness must 
notify the instructor prior to the start of the exam. They will then write a 
make-up exam to be scheduled at a later date. 
Late assignments will be deducted a full letter grade for each late day past 
the due date. Assignments submitted more than five days after the due date 
will receive a grade of zero. 
Course Policies related to Academic Integrity
Students are expected to complete their assignments individually and, while 
discussion of their projects is encouraged, no collaboration with other 
students is permitted. Plagarism software may be used.

Conduct in the Classroom – Culture of Respect
Substantial and constructive dialogue on challenging issues is an important 
part of academic inquiry and exchange. It requires willingness to listen and 
tolerance of opposing points of view. Consideration of individual differences 
and alternative viewpoints is required of all class members, towards each 
other, towards instructors, and towards guest speakers. While expressions of
differing perspectives are welcome and encouraged, the words and language
used should remain within acceptable bounds of civility and respect.
Diversity and Inclusion – Culture of Respect
Every person at Dalhousie has a right to be respected and safe. We believe 
inclusiveness is fundamental to education. We stand for equality. Dalhousie 
is strengthened in our diversity. We are a respectful and inclusive 
community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels 
welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes 
fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness (Strategic Priority 5.2). 
Additional diversity and inclusion information can be found at: 
http://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html
Student Code of Conduct
Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. 
The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if 
students don’t follow this community expectation. When appropriate, 
violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal manner - 
perhaps through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution can’t 
be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute 
resolution. The full Code of Student Conduct can be found at: 
https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/policies/student-life/code-of-
student-conduct.html
