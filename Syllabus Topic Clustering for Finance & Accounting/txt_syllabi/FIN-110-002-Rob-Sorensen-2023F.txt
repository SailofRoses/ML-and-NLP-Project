Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: 
 
• 
Calculate the time-value of money and use this information to solve for unknown payments, final

Use both simple and compound interest to calculate interest rate, maturity value, present value and 
time to maturity for items such as credit cards, student loans, treasury bills, commercial paper and 
promissory notes. 
• 
Convert between different nominal interest rates to compare investments. 
• 
Distinguish among several types of annuities and choose the appropriate formula to solve business-

credit repayments and refinancing. 
• 
Describe bonds and calculate bond purchase prices, bond market quotes and yield to maturity to 
make sound investment decisions. 
• 
Choose between sinking funds or amortization to calculate loan repayment schedules.

Quizzes: 
There will be a number of online quizzes during the term. You will complete the quizzes on your own time. For 
each quiz, you will be allowed up to three attempts with your highest score counting toward your grade. 
Of all the quizzes, your lowest quiz score will be dropped and the remaining quizzes will count equally toward 
your final grade. This allows you to miss a quiz when sick and still not impact your final grade. 
Please note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your computer is properly set up to work with D2L. No 
allowance will be made for quizzes that couldn’t be completed due to computer issues.  
Exams: 
There are two midterm exams and a final exam for this course.  
Students are allowed one 8 ½ x 11 sheet (both sides) on which to place any information they feel will help 
them to write the exam (except for copies of old exams). Typically, this would be formulae and examples from 
class. The sheet must be handwritten and you are required to submit it in with your exam.  In addition, you will 
need your calculator (you must have the TI BAII+ as detailed above). 
Cell phones, watches, music players, translators or similar devices are not permitted during exams. Students 
found with these devices will receive a score of zero on the exam. You may, however, use your phone after 
submitting your exam to scan and submit your worksheets. 
Please see the section below for further information on exam requirements. 
COURSE GUIDELINES & EXPECATIONS 
Students must be proficient with basic math and algebra techniques. In addition, it is expected that students 
are familiar with the operation of their calculators, and that they will participate in course activities and stay 
current with their homework. 
 
If you have a concern about a grade you have received for an evaluation, please come and see 
me as soon as possible. Refer to the Grade Review and Appeals policy for more information.
