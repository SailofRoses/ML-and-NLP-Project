Course Description 
This course serves as a rigorous introduction to entrepreneurship and small business development from the 
perspective of the entrepreneur. It is intended to be a self-contained course that introduces the concepts of 
idea generation, market analysis, fundraising, legal corporate structures, and basic financial accounting for 
entrepreneurial endeavors. Mastery of any individual subject area is beyond the scope of this class, but the 
student will be expected to understand the basic concepts introduced and demonstrate the attained 
knowledge through thoughtful comments and insightful questions in class, written in-class exams, and a 
graded team presentation on a topic relating to entrepreneurship. By understanding the basic building 
blocks of new venture initiation, students will be able to seek out additional resources (e.g. online materials, 
guest lectures, etc.) that can supplement the material learned in the course. 
 
While this course will focus extensively on the core fundamentals of building a business, the class will also 
emphasize the inherent experiential nature of entrepreneurship. Successful entrepreneurial students must 
always be learning from the collective small business and entrepreneurial experience available: from 
distinguished guest lectures on campus to family barbeques or a conversation with the local barber shop 
owner.  A two-fold approach will be adopted to expose students to the decisions faced by real life 
entrepreneurs. First, guest lecturers will be invited to speak about their first-hand experience. The emphasis 
of the guest lectures will be on small ventures, not mega-success stories like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  
 
In addition to the guest lectures, Harvard Business School cases will be utilized to expose students to the real 
decisions faced by entrepreneurs and introduce case-based learning. Case-based education is the dominant 
learning mechanism utilized in top business schools around the world today to prepare the next generation 
of business leaders. Cases are designed to present a snapshot in time when a business leader or leadership 
team needed to make a critical decision. A case provides significant detail and the core information to be 
considered by management when reaching a decision. These cases have been selected to highlight 
entrepreneurial decisions including marketing a new energy drink (West Coast Chill in 2010), disruptive 
innovation (Tesla in 2020), developing a new smartphone app (Discotech in 2020), fundraising for an early 
stage startup (Crowdfunding: A Tale of Two Campaigns, 2014) and commercializing social robots (Jibo in 
2015).

Classroom Matters 
Class attendance and participation are critical to providing a rich learning environment for your colleagues 
and critical for understanding the material presented.  Students are expected to read assigned material 
BEFORE each class, and come to class prepared to have an intellectual conversation about the assigned 
material. The instructor may rely on cold-calling and other techniques to foster a vibrant class discussion. 
Please note that the quality of participation matters much more than the quantity of participation. That is, 
high-quality participation means much more than merely talking a lot, it involves being articulate and 
focused in your comments or questions. However, the idea of a classroom environment is to be a “protected 
space” where students feel comfortable asking questions or expressing reasoned opinions. Any student 
disrespecting or belittling their fellow classmate’s genuine learning efforts in class will have their class 
participation grade significantly adversely impacted. 
 
Class attendance will be taken by the TA during every class. Students are expected to attend the entire 
lecture, and arriving late or leaving early may impact your class participation score.

Course Requirements 
Note Professor Wilson exclusively reserves the right to make case-by-case exceptions to the grading policies 
below. Students should understand that approved exceptions are EXTREMELY RARE and nearly all such 
requests will be denied by the instructors. Students must request exceptions to the policies below in writing 
(e.g. email), and should understand that WRITTEN APPROVAL from the instructor must be explicitly 
obtained or the request should be considered denied.

Grading Criteria 
You will receive an individual grade in this course based on your performance throughout the course. The 
grade will be determined as follows: 
 
Components of Final Course Grade 
Contribution to 
Grade 
(%) 
Attendance & Class Discussion (individual) 
20% 
Study Guide Exercises (individual) 
10% 
Exam #1 (individual) 
10% 
Exam # 2 (individual)  
              10% 
Final Exam (individual) 
30% 
Individual Case Write-Up 
2.5% 
Group Case Write-Ups (team) 
10% 
Group Business Pitch Idea Approval (team) 
2.5% 
Group Final Presentation (team) 
5.0% 
TOTAL 
100.0% 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final grades will be assigned based on a relative distribution. No more than 50% of the class will receive 
a grade of “A-” or above.  A typical grade distribution is approximately 40-45% of the class in the “A range”, 
approximately 40-45% of the class in the “B range”, and 10-20% other. 
 
Note: It is anticipated that all team members will receive the same grade for the group assignments.  However, 
individual students may have their grade lowered due to lack of contribution to the effort as determined by the 
professor based on observation and peer-review team feedback. 
 
Attendance and Class Participation 
Since a significant part of learning takes place during class sessions, attendance, active case preparation and 
class participation are all expected. If you miss more than TWO class sessions, your final grade will be 
lowered. In particular, for each additional absence, you will lose 12.5% of the final class participation grade 
(i.e. 5% reduction in your overall final grade). Missing more than fifteen minutes of any class may be 
considered a half-absence, while missing more than one hour of class will be considered a full absence.  Please 
consult the TA for additional information or clarification if needed.  Each student will be evaluated 
individually.  Class participation will be graded on a relative distribution. 
 
Please note, you should NOT take this class if you have any standing conflicts that would prevent you from 
being in class.  No accommodation whatsoever will be made under any circumstances for students who 
schedule other classes that partially or completely overlap with this course, either for their lecture 
component or any course requirements outside (e.g. exams).  Unfortunately, no accommodations of any kind 
will be made for students with internships, paid or unpaid, that prevent you from attending class.  In other 
words, you should take MGMT 160 if you can actually attend the lectures live.  Classes start promptly at the 
starting time so please plan your schedule where you have time to make it to class on time. 
   
Note: signing an attendance sheet for another student or having someone else sign in for you on an attendance 
sheet is blatant academic dishonesty (e.g. see below for Academic Integrity).  There are no warnings and 
students caught either having someone sign in for them or signing in for another student will lose between 50% 
- 100% of their final participation grade in the course.  Students may also be referred to the Dean of Students 
for further disciplinary action for academic dishonesty.

No Laptop/ No Cell-Phone/ No Electronic Devices Policy 
During lecture, case discussion, or guest speakers, we will have a “no laptop & no cell phone” policy.  Students 
are expected to pay attention during lecture and not be on social media or email or playing on their phones.  
We will do several exercises throughout the quarter for which an individual laptop/tablet will be helpful.  
The teacher will clearly indicate when it is appropriate to use your electronic devices.  At the sole discretion 
of the professor, you may receive a warning the first time you access your electronic devices outside of the 
appropriate time.  However, in general, each infraction of the no electronic devices policy will result in at 
least a 25% reduction of your final class participation score.  Any behavior considered disruptive will result 
in a 25% - 100% reduction of your final class participation score.   
 
Final Exam 
A 180 minute in-class, closed book, closed note, and closed computer (except for Respondus) comprehensive 
final exam will cover all the material covered in the class. The final exam may consist of multiple-choice, short 
answer, and essay questions. Students must take the final-exam using Respondus at the assigned time. No 
make-up examinations will be allowed. 
 
Exam #1 and Exam #2 
A 120 minute in-class, closed book, closed note, and closed computer (except for Respondus) comprehensive 
exams will cover all the material covered in the class (see Details Section). The exams may consist of multiple-
choice, short answer, and essay questions. Students must take the exam using Respondus at the assigned 
time. No make-up examinations will be allowed. 
 
Startup Simulation 
The class will play one interactive simulation during class as detailed later in the syllabus.  Active 
participation will be necessary to receive full credit for the simulation.  Students must be present at the 
assigned time for the simulation. No make-up simulations will be allowed.  In particular: 
 
• 
The Food Truck Challenge: will be counted towards the participation grade. Participation in the food 
truck challenge may be graded on a relative distribution. 
 
Note: To receive credit for the simulation, you MUST individually and personally purchase the simulation 
course pack listed above under "Required Reading" from HBSP.  You positively cannot share simulations with 
any other student.  Any student that hasn’t purchased the simulation course pack by 9 AM the day of the 
simulation will receive an automatic zero.   
 
Individual Case Write-Ups 
Each individual case write-up will consist of a two page paper that applies the material learned in class and 
applies critical reasoning skills to a business situation. Quantitative as well as qualitative analysis is expected. 
The individual case write-ups will be graded on a relative distribution. 
 
Group Case Write-Ups 
Each group case write-up will typically consist of a three page paper that applies the material learned in class 
and applies critical reasoning skills to a business situation. Quantitative as well as qualitative analysis is 
expected. The group case write-ups will be graded on a relative distribution. 
 
Study Guide Exercises 
Each week study questions will be posted on CCLE for the weekly assigned reading.  Students must 
individually complete the Study Guide Questions and upload their answers by the due date.  Students can 
either upload a PDF of their typed notes OR very clean scan/images of their notes uploaded as a PDF. This 
assignment will be graded on completion and the assignment being uploading on time.  This is an individual 
assignment and students should not work in groups or in shared documents on the study questions! 
 
 
Management 160: Entrepreneurship and Venture Initiation, Fall 2021 (Version 2021.09.23) 
Page 6 
 
Group Business Pitch Idea Approval 
Each team must meet with Prof. Wilson during the designated week with at least three distinct business 
ideas.  The team and Prof. Wilson with agree upon an idea for the final pre-feasibility business pitch group 
presentation. This assignment will be graded on completion once an idea is approved. 
 
Team Presentation 
Early in the quarter, the class will be divided into approximately 5 person teams. Each team will work 
together during the quarter to prepare a concise, PowerPoint presentation for the class representing a mini-
feasibility study for an approved business idea.  Detailed instructions for the format and style of the 
presentation and paper will be given during the quarter. In general, the presentation will be graded for 
clarity, reasoning, and the intelligent use of supporting evidence. Most of the research will be conducted 
online, and students will be expected to properly cite all resources used in preparing the presentation. To 
receive credit for the team presentation, students must be present during the group presentation during the 
assigned class time as given by the instructor. Students not present during the group presentation will be 
automatically assigned a 0% for the group presentation.  The presentations will be graded on a relative 
distribution. 
 
Note: It is anticipated that all team members will receive the same grade for the group assignments and final 
presentation.  However, individual students may have their grade lowered due to lack of contribution to the 
effort as determined by the professor based on observation and peer-review team feedback. 
 
Note:  Any student that elects the “Pass/No Pass” grading option for the course will not be assigned to a team 
and will instead be required to write a twenty-page individual paper on a topic similar to the team assignments 
as directed by the professor. 
 
Academic Integrity 
All students, without exception, must familiarize themselves with the academic integrity policies of UCLA as 
detailed in the Student Conduct Code on the Office of the Dean of Students website:  
 
http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/UCLACodeOfConduct_Rev030416.pdf 
 
In particular, we would like to emphasize the following excerpt from the “UCLA Student Conduct Code” PDF 
found on the Dean’s website which includes, but is not limited to, the following forbidden behavior:  
 
102.01a: Cheating 
Cheating includes, but is not limited to, the use of unauthorized materials, information, or study 
aids in any academic exercise; the alteration of any answers on a graded document before 
submitting it for re-grading; or the failure to observe the expressed procedures or instructions 
of an academic exercise (e.g., examination instructions regarding alternate seating or 
conversation during an examination). 
 
102.01b: Fabrication 
Fabrication includes, but is not limited to, falsification or invention of any information or 
citation in an academic exercise, including Fabrication or Falsification of Research. Fabrication 
of Research is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification of 
Research is manipulating research materials, equipment or processes, or changing or omitting 
data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. 
 
102.01c: Plagiarism 
Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the use of another person’s work (including words, 
ideas, designs, or data) without giving appropriate attribution or citation. This includes, but is 
 
Management 160: Entrepreneurship and Venture Initiation, Fall 2021 (Version 2021.09.23)

not limited to, representing, with or without the intent to deceive, part or all of an entire work 
obtained by purchase or otherwise, as the Student’s original work; the omission of or failure to 
acknowledge the true source of the work; or representing an altered but identifiable work of 
another person or the Student’s own previous work as if it were the Student’s original or new 
work.  Unless otherwise specified by the faculty member, all submissions, whether in draft or 
final form, to meet course requirements (including a paper, project, exam, computer program, 
oral presentation, or other work) must either be the Student’s own work, or must clearly 
acknowledge the source. 
 
102.01d: Multiple Submissions 
Multiple submissions includes, but is not limited to, the resubmission in identical or similar form 
by a student of any work which has been previously submitted for credit, whether at UCLA or 
any other school, college, or university in one course to fulfill the requirements of a second 
course, without the informed permission/consent of the instructor of the second course; or the 
submission for credit of work submitted for credit, in identical or similar form, in concurrent 
courses, without the permission/consent of the instructors of both courses.

Session 5: Entrepreneurial Strategy 
Learning 
Objectives: 
The purpose of strategy is to create a competitive advantage that generates 
superior, sustainable financial returns over the long run.  It is achieved by 
answering two fundamental questions: Where should we compete?  How 
should we compete?  Strategy is NOT tactics, execution, or a list of goals.  A firm 
employs a series of tactics and executes following its strategy to achieve a set of 
strategic objectives.  This session will introduce the fundamental concepts of 
entrepreneurial strategy and the popular frameworks of Blue Ocean Strategy 
and Porter’s Forces of Industry Analysis.

Session 6: Tesla Case 
Case Assignment 
Due: 
Case: Tesla, Inc., Frank T. Rothaermel, David R. King. 
 
The timeframe of the case is January 2020. 
 
Group two or three page paper to answer the following questions on the case: 
 
1. Tesla is the most valuable car company in the world.  Its stock is up 
almost 400% since January 1, 2020.  Is Tesla properly valued compared 
to Toyota or GM?  Note: you should not need to do detailed calculations 
or complex financial modeling to answer this question.  You can likely 
answer this question with a combination of simple math and strategic 
arguments.   
2. The case discusses EV (electric vehicles), ICE (internal combustion 
engine), and plugin hybrids (PHEV) models of cars.  ICE’s dominated the 
20th century.  For the sake of this question, assume that someday in the

Session 14: Jibo Case 
Case Assignment 
Due: 
Case: Jibo 
 
The timeframe of the case is February 2015. 
 
Group three page paper to answer the following questions on the “Jibo” case: 
 
1. 
Discuss Jibo’s early seed funding strategy from 2009-2013.  What were 
the influencers on the approach of Dr. Breazeal and Mr. Asher?  What 
were the strengths and weaknesses of the founding team?  Would you 
recommend any changes in the early stage funding approach at the time?  
2. 
Why did Jibo launch a crowdfunding campaign?  Why did they select 
Indiegogo instead of Kickstarter? 
3. 
At the time of the case, Jibo has raised $25.4M in Series A financing.  How 
has the approach and strategy of the company been influenced by the 
funding? In other words, what are the strengths of weaknesses of raising 
the significant Series A capital, in contrast, for example, to Pebble 
Watch’s Kickstarter campaign? 
4. 
The time frame of this case is very recent.  The founders secured the first 
investment for Jibo by January 2013.  If the team were raising their seed 
money today, would there be any differences in approach?
