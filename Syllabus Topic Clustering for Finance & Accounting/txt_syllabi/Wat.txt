COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES: ACTSC 221 is a course designed to provide students with the 
rudimentary mathematical knowledge necessary to pursue a career in financial services. It is highly practical with 
much of the material taken from real-life situations. The math covered in this course will prepare the student for 
courses in Corporate Finance, Investments, Intermediate Accounting, etc.

Assignments:  6 total (5 counted): 10% total (top 5 marks count) – Through Learn 
Five (5) Quizzes – In class:  
40% total, 8% each, in-class time   
Final Exam: 
 
 
50%; cumulative  Note: you must pass the final exam to pass the course. 
 
EXAMINATIONS: There will be five quizzes and one final exam.  The term tests will be written during normal 
class time on the scheduled dates.  The final exam will be two and one-half hours duration and will be scheduled 
during the fall examination period. The final exam is comprehensive, covering material throughout the course.  You 
must pass the final examination to receive a passing mark in this class. 
 
You may use a non-graphing, financial calculator or other calculator containing ln x and yx functions. You are NOT 
allowed to use programmable or graphing calculators on exams.  Bear in mind that marks on the examinations are 
allocated for complete setup of the solutions.  If all you have is the final answer, it will get zero marks regardless of 
its validity. 
 
Students must bring photo identification to the mid-term and final exams. Notwithstanding its relative weighting, 
students must pass the final exam in order to pass the course. If a student fails the final exam, the student’s final 
mark will be the lower of the calculated grade according to the above weighting (i.e. including the final exam), and 
48%.   
 
If you have an illness that will impair your performance on an examination, do not write the examination. No 
adjustment will be made for medical reasons after a student writes an exam. However, note that the experience of 
virtually all UW instructors is students missing an exam for any reason almost always perform worse than if they 
had attended all exams.    
 
An examination missed without adequate documentation will result in a grade of zero for the exam.  No makeup 
examinations will be given under any circumstances.  If a midterm examination is missed for a valid reason such as 
sickness or an emergency, the weight of the midterm exam will be added to the final examination.  In the event that 
a student is unable to sit a final exam during its regularly scheduled time, provided there is a satisfactory basis for 
the absence with appropriate supporting evidence, the student will normally write the final exam when final exams 
take place for the next offering of the course. The student will initially receive an INC grade for the course and no 
numeric grade will be provided until such time as the final exam is written and a final grade calculated.    
 
Re-grading requests should be made within one week after the return of the graded examinations. A regrading  
request after a due date will not be accepted. The instructor reserves the right to re-grade the entire examination. 
Appeals will only be considered where the total marks involved are 5% or more of the total available marks on the 
exam, because marks below the 5% cut-off do not materially affect the final course grade. Final exam grade appeal 
procedures are consistent with overall University policy.   
 
ASSIGNMENTS: Student success is highly correlated with ongoing preparation. There will be 6 assignments and 
each are weighted equally. In total, they count for 10% of your total grade.  The top 5 are counted for your mark.  
You may do them as many times as you wish and the highest mark is counted for each.  These are accessed through 
Learn.

LEARN COURSE WEBPAGE: Course-related information/materials such as course outlines, lecture notes, 
solutions, and class announcements will be available on the LEARN website (https://learn.uwaterloo.ca/).  It is 
students’ responsibility to download posted course materials and check for updates.    
 
EMAIL POLICY: The instructor will use students’ emails as a major way for out-of-the class communication (e.g. 
making some announcements, answering some common questions, etc.).  The LEARN group email list will be used 
for sending out class emails.  Students should make sure that they can get their emails via LEARN group email.  To 
communicate with the instructor via e-mail, use bmatheson@uwaterloo.ca.   
 
PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT POLICY: To foster a more professional learning environment and to develop 
habits that lead to success in the business work, all participants must engage in professional behavior, including: 1. 
No inappropriate talking in class.  2. Turn off mobile phones prior to class.   3. Arrive on time and leave at the 
designated time.  Please do not leave the class in the middle unless it is absolutely essential.  4. Plan outside 
activities to avoid conflicts with the activities outlined in the syllabus. 5. Agree to abide by the academic misconduct 
rules and procedures and code of ethics discussed below.  6. Acknowledging the importance of clarity of expression 
in written and oral communication and understanding that the course grade will be affected by your ability to 
communicate.   
 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Absolutely no cheating is allowed. Note on avoidance of academic offences: All 
students registered in the courses of the Faculty of Mathematics are expected to know what constitutes an academic 
offense, to avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their academic actions. When the 
commission of an offense is established, disciplinary penalties will be imposed in accord with Policy #71 (Student 
Academic Discipline). For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students are directed to 
consult the summary of Policy #71 in the student Academic Calendar (Section 1) or by using the link below:  
http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm. Other resources regarding the discipline policy include 
your academic advisor.    
 
RELEASE OF GRADES: Grades will be released through the course site on UW-Quest. Please note that 
University of Waterloo Policy 19 states that, “final examination and final course grades shall not be posted before 
the final examination period ends.”  I will not release marks through email or on the phone. 
 
DISABILITIES ASSISTANCE The Accessability Office is located in Needles Hall, Room 1132 and collaborates 
with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without 
compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the 
impact of your disability, please register with the office at the beginning of each academic term.
