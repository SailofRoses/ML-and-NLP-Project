ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
The Department of Economics and Finance is committed to maintaining the 
integrity and respectability of degrees conferred and course credit earned 
through our department. Academic dishonesty restricts the understanding of 
subject material by the perpetrator, distracts and discourages other class 
members, and reduces the value of the economic signal of degrees conferred 
through Texas A&M University - Commerce. Whether courses are online, 
face-to-face, or hybrid combinations; the faculty, staff, and student 
members of the Department of Economics and Finance are committed to 
protecting the integrity of our courses, regardless of the delivery method. 
 
All academic work must meet the standards contained in A Culture of 
Honesty: Policies and Procedures on Academic Honest.  Students are 
responsible for informing themselves about those standards and for 
observing the University Honor Code. Plagiarism occurs when a student 
submits work that is not his or her own. This includes copying from printed 
materials, websites, or from other people. All students are expected to turn 
in work that has been completed individually, unless otherwise informed by 
the 
instructor. 
Any 
assignment 
containing 
plagiarized 
material 
will 
automatically be graded as zero. 
 
Please read the following items for more specific information regarding 
academic dishonesty.
