Course Description
Calendar Description for ECON 371
The course explores decisions faced by managers of firms. In particular, decision-makers must determine which long-term real investment
opportunities to exploit. Once undertaken, managers must decide how to finance the projects, for example, by debt or equity. The course
develops both the conceptual framework and the tools required for these decisions. The course assumes prior familiarity with probability,
expected values, and variance.
Prereq: ECON 101 or ECON 100/COMM 103; ECON 221 or any prior course in probability and/or basic statistics; Level at least 2B. Antireq:
AFM 271/273, AFM 274/371, ACTSC 372 after fall 2014
The course focuses on investment decisions by businesses and individuals. It describes major players and types of financial instruments in
financial markets, and it offers the general framework of financial landscape. This course will describe the basics of how firms and
individuals make investment decisions and how they finance their investments. The goal is to understand financial markets and investment
strategies. The understanding of the most important financial problems leads to strategic planning and analytical understanding of possible
solutions. Today’s financial decisions are critical for the successes of the businesses in the future. This course will help students develop skills
applicable to financial decision-making processes within businesses as well as in their personal lives.
The objectives of this course are for students to:
understand the need for firms and individuals to make financial decisions and together work towards overcoming the universal
problem of scarcity;
appreciate the relevance of finance in a changing world;
develop the capacity to apply critical thinking to finance issues.

The course grade will be based on review quizzes, two midterm exams, and a final examination, which will be held during the Official
Examination Schedule. The midterm with the better mark will be worth 30% of your final grade, while the second-best midterm will be
worth 25% of your final grade. The final exam will constitute 35% of your final grade and will be comprehensive (i.e., cover all course
material from beginning to end). 
Please note that the Learn website does not have an option to adjust weights for each student individually. I will set constant weights for
each student of 25% for the first midterm and 30% for the second midterm in Learn, but I will be adjusting those weights individually in my
Excel sheet when calculating final grades at the end of the semester. 
There will also be a bonus grade up to 2% for participation (more on participation below under Participation). 
Review Quizzes
The purpose of the review quizzes is to help students identify and understand key concepts covered in the lectures and in the
textbook.
The format of the quizzes will mainly be multiple-choice questions, but there may also be some true-false questions, or short answer
questions.
The quizzes will be done online through the LEARN system.
There will be a limited, but a reasonably long, time window set up in LEARN during which each quiz will be available for completion.
There are two attempts for each quiz available and the better attempt counts.
Quizzes that are not submitted on time will automatically receive a grade of zero.
Participation 
Participation is recommended, and it will be rewarded through bonus marks up to the total of two percentage points (2%) that will be
added to the students’ final grade. Participation will be monitored through an online tool Learning Catalytics. The primary purpose of this
tool in this class is to enhance the feedback mechanism between students and the instructor so that we can identify areas that may require
special focus. You will be able to submit answers to in-class questions using Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or through
text message. Your participation grade will not depend on the correctness of your answers to the in-class questions. 
Learning Catalytics 
We will be using the Learning Catalytics classroom response system. Included with the purchase of a new text is a subscription to Learning
Catalytics (through MyLab), which is a web-based student response system. 
If you do not have a new text or code to MyLab, codes can be purchased separately through the bookstore, as it is the cheapest option
- $17.25 CND for 12 months.
Through the Learning Catalytics website the cost is $12 USD (6 months) or $20 USD (12 months).

Midterms and Final Exam
The format for midterms and the final exam will be a mix of multiple-choice questions, numerical calculation questions, and written
problems.
The final exam period for the Winter Term 2023 is April 13 - April 28 inclusive. More on the UW Final Examination policy can be
found here: http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams
(http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Acad-Regs-Assignments-Tests-and-Final-Exams)
The final exams will be scheduled by The Registrar’s Office. The default time for the completion of the final exam is any 150 minutes.
Only the Registrar’s Office can issue final grades.
This grading policy will be implemented strictly for all students in the course (with the exception of verified illnesses or self-isolation due to
COVID-19 – see below). 
Missing a Midterm Due to Illness During the Term
Missing a midterm will automatically result in a grade of zero for that midterm. If the illness can be documented1, with approval, you
may transfer the weight of the missed midterm to the final exam. This remedy is a privilege and not a right.
Missing a Midterm Due to Self-Isolation 
If the self-isolation can be documented, with approval, you may transfer the weight of the missed midterm to the final exam. This
remedy is a privilege and not a right.
Missing the Final Exam Due to Illness
Missing the final exam is a serious matter, which automatically results in a grade of zero for the final exam and possibly a failing
grade for the course. Please carefully read the Economics Department policy on deferred final exams for instructions.
Students are permitted to self-declare illness due to COVID-19 but will require a virtual Verification of Illness Form if they missed an
exam due to mental health or non-covid-19 related illness.
The Undergraduate Associate Chair will determine whether a deferred exam will be granted if required.
No deferred final exam will be provided for students who missed all the exams (including the final exam) in this course
Elective arrangements (such as travel plans) are not considered acceptable grounds for granting an accommodation.
Notes:
1. Students are permitted to self-declare illness due to COVID-19, but will require a virtual Verification of Illness Form if they missed an exam
due to mental health or non-covid-19 related illness.
Assignment Screening
No assignment screening will be used in this course.

Academic freedom at the University of Waterloo
Policy 33, Ethical Behaviour (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33) states, as one of its general
principles (Section 1), “The University supports academic freedom for all members of the University community. Academic freedom carries
with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest and
ethical quest for knowledge. In the context of this policy, 'academic freedom' refers to academic activities, including teaching and
scholarship, as is articulated in the principles set out in the Memorandum of Agreement between the FAUW and the University of Waterloo,
1998 (Article 6). The academic environment which fosters free debate may from time to time include the presentation or discussion of
unpopular opinions or controversial material. Such material shall be dealt with as openly, respectfully and sensitively as possible.” This
definition is repeated in Policies 70 and 71, and in the Memorandum of Agreement, Section 6
Cross-listed courses
Please note that a cross-listed course will count in all respective averages no matter under which subject code it has been taken. For
example, a PHIL/PSCI cross-list will count in a Philosophy major average, even if the course was taken under the Political Science subject
code.

University Policy
Academic integrity: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected
to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity (https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-
integrity/) for more information.]
Grievance: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have
grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4 (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-
procedures-guidelines/policy-70) . When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide

Discipline: A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take
responsibility for their actions. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity (https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/) for more information.] A
student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism,
cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the
undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student
Discipline (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71) . For typical penalties, check Guidelines for the

procedures-guidelines/policy-70) (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-
procedures-guidelines/policy-71) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should
refer to Policy 72, Student Appeals (https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72) .

Turnitin.com: Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all
materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given
an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students
will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and
alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.
It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided,
wish to submit alternate assignment.
