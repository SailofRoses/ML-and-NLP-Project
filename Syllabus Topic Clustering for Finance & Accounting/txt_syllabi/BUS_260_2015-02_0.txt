COURSE DESCRIPTION 
 
In BUS260 we begin to understand the science of money management in a corporate 
context.  We begin to examine how firms value and assess risk, and make financial 
decisions across a variety of contexts, and time frames.

LEARNING OUTCOMES 
 
Upon successful completion of the course, students will have demonstrated the ability  
 
1. To understand and apply theories in corporate finance to real world examples 
 
2. To develop an understanding of the basic principles of both long term and short term 
financial planning 
 
3. To understand how financing and investment decisions interact to affect value. 
 
COURSE FORMAT 
Course content will be presented principally through lectures, and sample problems.   I 
encourage all students to raise and answer questions and get actively involved in any 
class discussions that might arise.    
 
If you require additional assistance, I am available to all students during my scheduled 
office hours.  Students are encouraged to make an appointment during these times, as 
appointments will take precedence over ‘drop-ins.’  A short visit is often all it takes to 
clear up a problem area.   
Given the volume of material that needs to be covered in this course, I have to conduct 
classes on the assumption that the assigned material has been read and studied.  In the 
end, if you are doing the assigned readings and preparing with exercises before class, 
your class room experience should be energizing.   
Homework  
 
All required readings, and exercises are listed in the calendar below. Students are 
responsible for correcting their own work using the Solutions Manual for the text, which 
includes answers to the end-of-chapter questions and problems. The Solutions Manual is 
available on-line at our course website .  Ensure that you understand the problems; this 
course is sequential with many of the lessons building on previous lessons. 
Evaluations 
 
There will be six tests, worth 5% each (30% total). The tests will be approximately 30 
Finance I 
 
5 
minutes long and will be written at the beginning of the class. Specific dates are noted 
on the syllabus. The purpose of these tests is to help you master the material on a 
chapter-by-chapter basis. Questions on the tests will be very similar to problems studied 
in class and/or the assigned self-study questions. 
 
Business 260 has a midterm and a final examination, both of which must be completed 
within the scheduled class time.  
 
If you must miss a test or exam, it is your responsibility to reschedule an alternative date 
before your planned absence. 
 
Examples of acceptable (valid) reasons for missing a scheduled test or exam include 
personal illness (supported by a doctor’s note) or absence required by your employer 
(supported by a letter from your employer). Only one such deferral is allowed per 
semester. If no valid reason is given, your mark on that test will be “0.” 
 
 
The 3-hour final exam is comprehensive however is weighted 70% to material covered 
after the midterm, and 30% to material beforehand.   
 
The final grade for this course will be determined as follows: 
 
Tests (6 @ 5% each) 
30% 
Midterm Exam 
30% 
Final Exam 
40% 
Total 
100%

ACADEMIC AND STUDENT CONDUCT 
 
Information on academic standing and student rights and responsibilities can be found in 
the Academic Regulations: 
https://www.yukoncollege.yk.ca/downloads/Yukon_College_Academic_Regulations_and_
Procedures_-_August_2013_final_v1.pdf 
 
Attendance  
 
Regular student attendance and preparation are essential to enjoying this course.  
Learning finance concepts is no easy task.  For the great majority of students, these 
concepts are far from intuitive, and mastering them requires hard work.  This work will 
inevitably involve a lot of careful reading and repetition, and in class engagement.   
 
Professional Conduct 
Students are expected to behave in a respectful and courteous manner during class, as is 
required in any workplace.  This includes turning off all personal communication devices. 
 Students who fail to demonstrate professionalism in the classroom and exhibit 
distracting/disrupting behaviours will be asked to leave.    
 
Cheating 
 
Cheating involves actual, intended, or attempted deception and/or dishonest action 
in relation to any academic work of Yukon College. The penalties for academic 
dishonesty are severe and are described in section 4.02 and 4.03 of Yukon College’s 
Academic Regulations and Procedures.  
 
Examples of cheating include the following: 
Taking unauthorized material into an evaluation and/or talking or communicating 
with another student during an evaluation. Unauthorized material in an evaluation 
will be regarded as attempted deception. Unauthorized material includes any 
notes/documents on your person and non-permitted equipment/devices (e.g. a 
prohibited model of calculator or an iPhone). If after the evaluation has started it is 
discovered that you have unauthorized material in your possession, including any 
information written on a part of your body or on clothing, it will automatically be 
assumed that cheating has taken place. The consequence will be the award of a mark 
of zero for the evaluation affected. Talking or communicating with another student 
during an evaluation is also considered cheating. You are not allowed to talk or 
Finance I 
 
7 
communicate in any way with another student whilst you are writing the evaluation. 
Talking or communicating with another student during a test/exam may result in you 
receiving a mark of zero for that evaluation. 
 
Plagiarism 
 
Plagiarism is a serious academic offence. Plagiarism occurs when students 
present the words of someone else as their own. Plagiarism can be the deliberate 
use of a whole piece of another person’s writing, but more frequently it occurs 
when students fail to acknowledge and document sources from which they have 
taken material. Whenever the words, research or ideas of others are directly 
quoted or paraphrased, they must be documented according to an accepted 
manuscript style (e.g., APA, CSE, MLA, etc.). Resubmitting a paper which has 
previously received credit is also considered plagiarism. Students who plagiarize 
material for assignments will receive a mark of zero (F) on the assignment and 
may fail the course. Plagiarism may also result in dismissal from a program of 
study or the College.
