3. Aim and Learning Outcomes
Module Rationale
Financial decisions and their implications are required to be considered by all organisations. The 
accounting function cannot be viewed in isolation form the other key functional areas of management 
and it is important therefore, that managers understand the integrative nature of financial decision-
making both at an operational and strategic level.
Overall Aim of the Module 
The aim of the module is to provide participants with an introduction to the financial issues and 
techniques involved in managerial decision-making and control. The module will also aim to develop 
integrative, analytical, reflective and managerial decision-making skills.
Learning Outcomes
Successful participants will be able to:
	

1)
Demonstrate knowledge of the effect financial decisions have on the financial performance and 
position of a business and comment authoritatively on financial decision-making processes
2)
Identify, analyse and synthesize materials from primary and secondary source materials that 
assist in the understanding of accounting 
3)
Interpret financial statements intelligently and appreciate the role of financial techniques as an aid 
to managerial decision making and control 
4)
Develop a range of transferable skills, including problem solving and analysis, team working, 
communication and critical reflection
  What you should be able to do by the end of this module?
