# Zhengqi Chen – NLP & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a selection of my applied machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) projects from the University of Toronto. These projects demonstrate practical skills in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation using real-world datasets and academic applications.

## 📌 Natural Language Processing (RSM317)

### 🧠 Sentiment Analysis for Product Quality
- Built a sentiment classifier using **Keras** with deep learning architecture for product reviews.
- Preprocessing included tokenization, stopword removal, unigram/bigram extraction.
- Achieved **88% accuracy** with unigram features — highest in the course.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 📚 Syllabus Topic Clustering for Finance & Accounting
- Designed an NLP pipeline for clustering syllabus content by topic.
- Performed **tokenization, stopword removal**, and **lemmatization**.
- Applied **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering** and both **guided/unguided LDA topic modeling**.
- Identified three distinct topics using **cosine similarity** and domain-specific vocabulary.

## 📌 Machine Learning in Finance (RSM338)

### 📈 ML-Driven Portfolio Optimization
- Replicated Ao, Li, and Zheng (2019) by constructing a **minimum-variance frontier** for 103 assets.
- Replaced plug-in estimator with **MAXSER rule**, comparing **Lasso** vs **Ridge** regression for regularization.
- Implemented portfolio optimization in Python using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.

### 💳 Credit Card Approval Automation
- Built and compared classifiers: **LDA**, **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, and **XGBoost Tree**.
- Used **NCBC dataset** to automate the credit card approval process.
- Employed **K-fold cross-validation** and evaluated with precision, recall, F1 Score.
- Found **logistic regression** to be most effective in accuracy and reducing labor cost.
